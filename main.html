				<p>Currently enrolled at CCSU as a junior in the honors CS department. I enjoy taking part in the CS club on campus. Although I have only been coding for a little over 2 years, I have a growing passion for the challenge.</p><br></br>
				<p>I have worked on 2 major projects so far in my studies. The first being Dijkstra's algorithm in my data structures class. My partner and I used this algorithm to calculate the fasest route for different planes to travel to different airports throughout the country.  The last project was in my Artificial Intelligence class this past semester, where I studied Affective Computing</p>
